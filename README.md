# data-analyst-portfolio


Welcome to my data analyst portfolio! Here you will find my recent work as a data analyst that contains new techniques and technologies I've learned and would like to showcase. In this README, I'll provide a general overview of what you can expect from this portfolio.

I've organized my projects into separate folders, each containing its own README file summarizing project details and goals. Within each project folder, you'll find additional files that are part of their respective project, and provide further insights and explanations.

Feel free to explore each project to gain a deeper understanding of the analyses conducted and the insights uncovered.

If you'd like to learn more about my professional background and experience, feel free to check out my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/yxqfdr4tbyijwlpa3qiwr/Tehrani_Aryan_2024_Resume.pdf?rlkey=0xkjo83pe39kt0c1hmqdn9bti&dl=0) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/aryan-t-5b5b97295).

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find my portfolio informative!
